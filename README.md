# 🧠 AI-Powered Dashboard Builder with Streamlit

An intelligent Streamlit application that integrates **OpenAI’s API** to help users **generate, refine, and maintain interactive data dashboards** through conversational AI. The app enables you to upload datasets, analyze data, and build visual dashboards — all through natural language chat.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to combine **Streamlit**, **Python**, and **OpenAI’s GPT models** to create an **AI-driven coding assistant** that can:

* Upload and explore datasets.
* Automatically generate Python code for analysis and visualization.
* Build and refine dynamic dashboards interactively.
* Deploy and maintain dashboards directly on **Streamlit Community Cloud**.

The goal is to make **data analysis and dashboard development** more accessible by using **AI to automate code generation** and provide conversational support inside Streamlit.

## 🧩 Features

✅ **AI Chat Assistant** — Interact with an embedded AI assistant to generate or edit Python code for your dashboard.
✅ **Data Upload & Preparation** — Upload CSV files, clean data, and perform basic exploration interactively.
✅ **Automated Data Visualization** — Generate plots and dashboards through simple natural language prompts.
✅ **Dynamic Filters & Layouts** — Add filters, selectors, and charts dynamically based on your dataset.
✅ **Deployment Ready** — Easily deploy and maintain the app on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varungowda02/Build-with-AI-AI-Powered-Dashboards-with-Streamlit.git
   cd Build-with-AI-AI-Powered-Dashboards-with-Streamlit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your OpenAI API key**
   Add your openAI api key in:

   ```bash
   openai_key.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run 04_06b.py
   ```
   For Deployment use ".../Chapter_4/Landon_Hotel_Dashboard.py"
   ```bash
   streamlit run Landon_Hotel_Dashboard.py.py
   ```
   To run test cases in ".../Chapter_4/04_05b.py"
   ```bash
   pytest 04_05b.py
   ```
