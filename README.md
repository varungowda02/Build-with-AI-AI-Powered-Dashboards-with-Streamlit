## Course Description

In this hands-on course, data science consultant Megan Silvey guides you through how to use Streamlit to build web applications. In particular, learners will build an AI-powered coding assistant in Streamlit that helps generate, refine, and maintain interactive data dashboards using Python and OpenAI’s free‑tier API. Learners will start with building their Streamlit chat-based AI assistant. Learners will then learn how to load, prepare, and analyze their data in Streamlit. Then, learners will build dynamic dashboards with various visualizations and filters through conversational interactions with an embedded AI assistant. Finally, learners will learn how to test, maintain, and deploy their fully functional AI-powered dashboard on Streamlit Community Cloud.

# File Structure
There is one branch for this course containing four chapter folders corresponding to the four chapters in the course. Inside these chapter folders are the coding exercise files. The naming convention for the exercise files is CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the branch named 02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

All coding exercise files will have a beginning and an end state, for example '02_03e' would be the ending file for the third movie in the second chapter. These are marked with the letters b for "beginning" and e for "end". The b file contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The e file contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
